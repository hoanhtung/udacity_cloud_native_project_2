gRPC endpoints:
- Location service

Use proto file:
- You can generate proto file in `scripts` folder with cmd: `bash gen_protos.sh`
- After generating, you can see the files like *_pb2.py, *_pb2_grpc.py (here is Location)
- And then, you can use resource from the files to import into gRPC service

* Can use BloomRPC tool to test gRPC endpoints
